## 🔍 Tasks Performed

1. Loaded the dataset using Pandas  
2. Identified missing values using `.isnull().sum()`  
3. Visualized missing value patterns using bar charts  
4. Applied median imputation for numerical features  
5. Applied mode imputation for categorical features  
6. Removed columns with extremely high missing values  
7. Validated the dataset after cleaning  
8. Compared dataset size and quality before and after cleaning  
9. Exported the cleaned dataset
